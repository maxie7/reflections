When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When i have more than one work place or i just used to work remotely.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

+: it (auto) joins the files into one branch accepting all the changes
-: it (auto) has both code changes in one file if it was modifying during previous commit.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because i only know when i need to update my repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

See the documentation in GitHub or in other sources.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can erase and get back with your and other changes and etc.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

GitHub is great, but you can use Bitbucket instead of it.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I make changes in a separate branch when i'm not sure the changes i made (want to make) will be accepted by all the collaborators of the project at GitHub. Benefits: you can develop several ways of making changes and then choose only one branch and to merge it with the master branch and the others can be deleted.
